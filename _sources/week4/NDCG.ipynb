    "# **Understanding NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to NDCG**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NDCG** is a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of search engines and recommendation systems. It measures how well a system ranks relevant items higher than irrelevant ones. It is particularly useful in situations where the relevance of items can vary and needs to be considered in a ranked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DCG** is a measure of the usefulness of a document based on its position in the ranking list. It takes into account both the relevance of the document and its position in the list. The gain of a document is \"discounted\" logarithmically, meaning that a document appearing lower in the list contributes less to the DCG score.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "The DCG for a set of retrieved documents is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\text{DCG}_p = \\frac{\\text{rel}_1}{\\log_2(2)} + \\frac{\\text{rel}_2}{\\log_2(3)} + \\frac{\\text{rel}_3}{\\log_2(4)} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\text{rel}_p}{\\log_2(p+1)} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\text{rel}_i$ is the relevance score of the document at position $p$.\n",
    "- $p$ is the position up to which DCG is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pros:**\n",
    "- **Intuitive:** DCG is easy to understand and calculate.\n",
    "- **Focus on Position:** It takes into account the position of relevant documents, giving higher scores to documents appearing earlier in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cons:**\n",
    "- **Absolute Scores:** DCG values are absolute and can be difficult to interpret across different queries or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "   \n",
    "### **2.2 Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain (IDCG)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**IDCG** is the DCG score of the ideal ranking, where documents are ordered by their relevance in descending order. It serves as the baseline for measuring the effectiveness of the actual ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDCG is calculated similarly to DCG but with the documents sorted by relevance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\text{IDCG}_p = \\frac{\\text{rel}_{\\text{ideal}_1}}{\\log_2(2)} + \\frac{\\text{rel}_{\\text{ideal}_2}}{\\log_2(3)} + \\frac{\\text{rel}_{\\text{ideal}_3}}{\\log_2(4)} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\text{rel}_{\\text{ideal}_p}}{\\log_2(p+1)} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{rel}_{\\text{ideal}_p}$ is the relevance score of the document at position $p$ in the ideal ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pros:**\n",
    "- **Benchmarking:** Provides a benchmark to compare the DCG of the actual ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cons:**\n",
    "- **Computationally Intensive:** Requires knowledge of the ideal relevance order, which may not always be feasible.\n",

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>GELU adds non-linearity to help the model learn complex functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dropout reduces overfitting by randomly deactivating some neurons during training.</p></li>
<li><p>Softmax converts raw outputs into probabilities, used in the final output layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Adam updates the model’s parameters during training, improving convergence speed and stability.</p></li>
<li><p>Forward Propagation: In this step, the input tokens are converted into embeddings, passed through self-attention layers, and processed by feed-forward layers with activation functions like GELU. Dropout and layer normalization stabilize the model, while softmax generates probabilities for the final predictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Backward Propagation: During this step, the gradients of the loss function with respect to each parameter are calculated, allowing the optimizer (Adam) to update the model’s weights. This process repeats during training, helping the model learn patterns from the data.</p></li>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>[UNK]:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Purpose: Unknown token.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage: Represents any word that is not in the model’s vocabulary. If an input token cannot be mapped to a known word, it is replaced with this token.</p></li>
